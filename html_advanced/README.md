Project Overview
In this project, I will play the role of a web developer tasked with translating a designer's creative masterpiece into HTML. However, there's a twist—this is all about structure and semantics, so I'm leaving my CSS and styling tools behind for now. My goal is to create clean and meaningful HTML markup that closely follows the provided design.

Project Objectives

The main objectives in this project are as follows:

Access the Figma Design: Sign in to Figma and duplicate the design file to your drafts for reference.

HTML Structure: Create an HTML file that mirrors the layout and structure of the Figma design. Pay careful attention to the organization and nesting of elements to ensure a semantically correct structure.

Semantic Markup: Use HTML tags and elements to convey the meaning and purpose of each section and content block. Ensure that your HTML code is semantically meaningful.

Typography: Implement text elements with appropriate fonts, sizes, and weights as per the design.

Images: Include any images or icons specified in the design within your HTML structure.

Links: Create any links or navigation elements as per the design.

Comments: Add comments to your HTML code to explain the purpose and function of each section or element, especially if it may not be immediately obvious.

Validation: Validate your HTML code to ensure it adheres to web standards and is error-free.

Documentation: Document any deviations or compromises made during the HTML implementation, especially if certain design elements were challenging to replicate exactly.
